# CloudWave Full Stack Code Challenge ~ Wave Chat
CloudWave have provided scaffolding for both the front and back end of the challenge, to save you time.

## Front-end

### Configuration
This application uses Vite, ReactJS, Typescript and vitest for testing. `tsconfig.json` has been pre-configured for the environment and hot reloading has been set up for you.

⚠️ **Some files may throw typescript errors due to empty placeholder files or commented out code.**

&nbsp;
### Linting
There's `stylelint` for linting SCSS files and `eslint` for linting code. You can lint the application with the `lint` and `lint:styles` commands in `package.json`.

⚠️ **Some files may throw linting warnings due to commented out scaffolding code.**

&nbsp;
### UI & Components
We've added `ant design` for you to use, which comes with a selection of UI React components and style classes out of the box.

Read more [here](https://ant.design/).

Not comfortable with Ant design? Feel free to use native HTML elements or another component library, such as `material-ui` or `react-bootstrap`.

&nbsp;
### Routing
This challenge uses `react-router` for routing.

&nbsp;
### Socket IO
Read more [here](https://socket.io/). The examples on the home page should be enough for you to complete the challenge.

&nbsp;
## Back-end

### Configuration
This application uses typescript and jest. `tsconfig.json` has been pre-configured for the environment.

&nbsp;
### Socket IO
The HTTP server with socket.io are already connected. The socket server will automatically run by default on port 3001.

&nbsp;
### Hot Reload
The backend server supports hot reload using `nodemon`. Any changes you make to files will automatically be updated if the server is started with the `start:dev` command.
